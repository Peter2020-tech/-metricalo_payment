### Key sections to edit:
- Replace `paynow` database with your actual database name.
- Replace the example endpoint/CLI command parameters with your real values if they change.
- If you implement tests, Docker, or additional features, add them to the README as necessary.

Let me know if you'd like to modify or expand any sections!
